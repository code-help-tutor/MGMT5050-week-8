MGMT5050 | Term 3, 2024 MGMT5050 Assessment Guide

# Welcome to the course

Dear student

Welcome to MGMT5050 – Responsible Business Professionalism.

This course may be unlike other courses you’ve taken at university.

There are no tests or exams.

There is no off-by-heart learning.

There is no simple calculation to guarantee success.

Instead, this course aims to transform you as an individual, a student, and a developing professional through a deep focus on sustainability, ethics, leadership, and responsible professionalism.

There are three main main components to the course:

1. **Pre-class activities**

In preparation for each week’s learning, you’ll work through current, stimulating multimedia content accessible on Moodle. This will open your mind to new ways of thinking about the course’s topics.

2. **Synthesis & Integration (S&I) session (replaces traditional lectures)**

In these weekly interactive sessions, your lecturers will share vital content to support your learning. We encourage you to attend, ask questions, and connect with your peers.

3. **Learning in Practice (LiP) session (replaces traditional tutorials)**

In the LiPs, your tutor will guide you on a journey of self-growth, supporting your development of critical competencies to support you in the workplace and beyond.

We are passionate about this course and can’t wait to take this learning journey with you.

Warm regards

Gabi, Jing, Lynn and the MGMT5050 team

# Submission guidelines

The Assessment guide includes several icons. Here’s what each one means:

Due Date | Weighting | Format | Length/Duration | Submission
---|---|---|---|---
Keep the following in mind when submitting your assessments:

- **Turnitin**

Turnitin checks your work for originality and proper citation. It compares your submission with other students’ work, online content, and selected resources. If you need to submit via Turnitin, you’ll find the link on your Moodle course page. More details are available on the Turnitin student information site.

- **Submitting your assignments**

• Ensure you submit the correct assessment using the right link on Moodle. After the deadline, no changes can be made.

• Upload your work as a Word document (not PDF).

• All times are in Australian Eastern Standard/Daylight Time (AEST).

- **Viva Voce**

You might be asked to do a viva voce for any submitted assignment. This is an interview where you discuss your assignment to show your understanding and preparation.

- **Late Submissions**

Late submissions lose 5% of the total mark per day. After five days past the due date, the submission will receive a zero grade.

Papers are considered late if:

• Assignments have been submitted in the wrong format.

• An incorrect assignment has been submitted. This refers specifically to a paper from another course.

If you submit a draft/incorrect version of the assignment, what is submitted by the deadline is what will be graded.

- **Extensions**

Plan ahead to meet deadlines. Extensions are only given if Special Consideration is awarded.

There will be no extensions for the 10 Minute Debriefs, Reflective Wikis or class participation.

- **Special Consideration**

The Special Consideration process helps if unexpected events affect your ability to perform in an assessment. It applies when such events prevent completion or submission of work or significantly affect performance. Click this link to see a list of example circumstances.

You can apply for Special Consideration via the central UNSW Special Consideration portal on myUNSW (see My Student Profile > Special Consideration).

# Academic integrity in MGMT5050

Developing and showing academic integrity is an important part of your work in MGMT5050. See below for important information about academic integrity in this course.

- **Harvard referencing**

We use the Harvard refencing style in MGMT5050.

Using Harvard referencing helps you to clearly communicate the sources that have contributed to your thinking, which is an important skill both in academic settings and in your future career.

Here’s how you can effectively use Harvard referencing in your assignments:

• **In-Text Citations**: When you mention someone else’s ideas, make sure to include the author's last name, the year of publication. For example: (Smith, 2020, p. 23).

• **Reference List**: At the end of your document, include a list of all the sources you’ve cited. This list provides full details of each source, allowing readers to find and read the original material if they wish.

• **Why It Matters**: Harvard referencing is not just a requirement; it’s a way to give credit to the authors whose work has helped you form your ideas. It shows that your arguments are based on solid, credible information, strengthening your work and making it more persuasive.

• **NOTE**: We discourage the use of direct quotes because these don’t show your ability to apply your research.

For more about Harvard Referencing, visit the UNSW Harvard Referencing Guide.

- **Use of generative AI (GenAI)**

MGMT5050 acknowledges GenAI's growing impact in universities and the business world. For this reason, we have integrated its use into our assignments in an ethical way that supports independent thought and learning.

To ensure academic integrity and the authenticity of your work, please follow these guidelines:

• **No AI rewriting**: You are not permitted to use AI to rewrite your work, whether it was originally written in English or any other language. “Rewriting” involves using AI to change the wording, structure, or phrasing of your original text. Your work should reflect your own ideas and understanding. This is not a language course, so while we expect you to use a word processor for spelling and grammar checks, perfection in language is not the goal.

• **No full translation**: Using a translator for full translations is unacceptable and will be referred to the Conduct and Integrity Office.

• **Check each assessment’s rules**: Each MGMT5050 assessment has different guidelines, so it is crucial to check the specific rules and guidance regarding the use of GenAI for each assessment.

• **Acknowledge AI use**: If you use AI in any form, you must acknowledge and reference it as per the UNSW Guide for Referencing & Acknowledging the Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools.

• **Consequences for misuse**: Any inappropriate or prohibited use of GenAI will be reported and escalated to the Conduct and Integrity Office (CIO).

- **Keep track of your process**

To ensure that your work is properly documented and reflects the development of your ideas, we highly recommend that you create and develop all your assignments using either Google Docs or your Microsoft online account. These platforms automatically save your work in real-time, providing a clear record of your progress and allowing you to easily demonstrate the development of your work if required. Handwritten documents may not be sufficient for this.

# Assessment 1: Memo

**Week 3: 1pm, Friday 27 September (AEST)**

**15%**

**Written organisational memo: documenting the work and the process**

**750 words +/-10% plus reference list (i.e., the reference list is not included in this word count limit)**

**Via Turnitin**

## Description of assessment task

You are a recent graduate working at EcoAnalytics, a business analysis company specialising in providing data-driven insights and strategic recommendations to organisations seeking to improve their environmental sustainability.

EcoAnalytics has built a strong reputation for its commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and environmental responsibility, helping companies reduce their carbon footprints, optimise resource use, and adopt greener practices.

As EcoAnalytics has grown, however, its operations have expanded to include advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning services. This has led to a sharp increase in energy consumption from its high-computation technologies. Additionally, the reliance on cloud services and data centres only sometimes powered by renewable energy has further contributed to the company's environmental impact.

You are concerned that public perception of EcoAnalytics may turn negative because the reliance on advanced technology could appear to contradict its commitment to environmental sustainability. You decide to write a memo to the CEO, outlining your concerns and suggesting ways that EcoAnalytics can realign its operations with its sustainability goals.

Given multiple pressures on your time, you decide to use GenAI to help you get started:

Your memo should:

- Outline your concerns, highlighting their importance considering EcoAnalytics’s commitment to sustainability.
- Discuss the significance of environmental sustainability in business and EcoAnalytics’s potential role in contributing to this.
- Make recommendations on how EcoAnalytics can remain a leader in sustainability while embracing technological innovation.
- Incorporate the UN SDGs, reflecting EcoAnalytics’s commitment to sustainability.

To support your thinking, look at the following extract from Accenture’s 2022 report Uniting Technology and Sustainability.

You must reference this extract in your memo.

(For your interest: click [here](for the full report))

# Assessment 1: Supporting information

## What is a memo?

A memo is an internal professional document that you would give to your manager to advance an idea. It must be clear, factually correct, and supported by credible evidence.

Click [here](for guidance on how to write a report).

## How to use GenAI in this task?

1. **Create the base memo**:

Create a base memo using GenAI (e.g., ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, Claude).

2. **Add your own input**:

Apply your own critical thinking to the AI-generated text and make necessary enhancements. Use track changes in the text to show any changes that you’ve made to the text. Use comments to explain your additions/deletions/refinements.

o Carefully fact-check the AI-generated content. Any incorrect or discriminatory content will be considered unsatisfactory.

o Memos that rely solely on AI-generated content without significant personal input will be deemed unsatisfactory. You are expected to change, rewrite or adjust at least 50% of the memo’s content.

3. **Ensure Academic Integrity**

- **Disclose your prompt**:

o Include the prompt you used to generate the base memo at the beginning of your memo.

- **Referencing**:

o Use the Harvard referencing system to acknowledge sources used.

o Ensure all citations are accurate and credible.

o Using false citations will trigger an integrity investigation, which may result in your submission being escalated to the Conduct and Integrity Office (CIO).

- **AI-Generated Content**:

o Cite your use of GenAI.

o Any work detected as GenAI, if used incorrectly, inappropriately, or without proper citation, will be investigated. Violations may lead to your submission being escalated to the CIO.

- **AI Usage Report**:

o Turnitin will generate an AI usage report for your submission.

o This report will not be available to students but will be visible to your marker.

## Other task requirements:

- **Use of Course Materials**:

• You should ONLY use the extract from the Accenture report linked above and materials from Weeks 1 and 2 of this course. This includes the S&I lectures, LiP workshops, and materials from the Pre-Learning Modules available on Moodle.

- **Originality and Language Requirements**:

• Your work must be written in your own words. Do not write your paper in another language and then translate it into English. This will be considered computer-generated work and may be escalated to the Conduct and Integrity Office.

- **Academic integrity**:

• Use the Harvard referencing system to acknowledge sources used.

• Remember to cite your use of GenAI.

- **Format requirements**:

• 12-point font, Arial or Times New Roman

• Harvard referenced

• 1.5 line spaced

• Double return between paragraphs

• Left justified

• Min 2.5 cm margins

• Must be uploaded in a Word document with track changes shown and comments to the document to show your thinking and progress of work.

## Submission instructions

Submission must be made via the Turnitin submission link under the Assessment Hub.

## Supporting resources and links

# Assessment 2: Report

**Week 7: 1pm, Friday 25 October (AEST)**

**30%**

**Written report, components task**

**1700 words +/- 10% plus reference list (i.e., the reference list is not included in this word count limit)**

**Via Turnitin**

## Description of assessment task

The ability to complete a professional report at work will be expected of you as a graduating Master’s student. In this assessment, you will apply the tools and concepts you have been exposed to and demonstrate the skills you developed over the course's first half. Instead of completing a full report, you will submit a series of report components. These components will help you learn the process of doing a report.

**Topic**

Fashion brand H&M’s 2023 Sustainability Disclosure asserts that “across our entire value chain we strive to make a positive impact on people” (p7). However, it has encountered significant criticism regarding ethical and sustainability concerns.

Consider the following three critical ethical and sustainability issues facing H&M:

- **Critical Issue 1 – Greenwashing**

▫ Critics argue that H&M’s sustainability initiatives such as its Conscious Collection, in which each piece is made from sustainably sourced material, are more about marketing than making meaningful change.

- **Critical Issue 2 – Fast fashion**

▫ H&M produces large volumes of clothing quickly to keep up with changing trends. This overproduction contributes to significant waste and environmental degradation.

- **Critical Issue 3 – Labour issues**

▫ H&M faces significant labour issues, including low wages, poor working conditions, and inadequate monitoring of its supply chain.

For this assignment, pick ONLY ONE critical issue from the three mentioned above.

Using your chosen critical issue, produce the following five report components.

**Part A: 5W framework**

• Use the 5Ws framework to summarise the critical issue. Be sure to address each of the 5Ws directly.

• Include in-text citations to support your points.

• Write this part as a narrative (i.e. no dot points).

• Write this as a narrative from a 3rd person point of view

• Length: 150 - 200 words.

**Part B: PESTEL**

• Conduct a PESTEL analysis in a 6 - box grid. Include citations to support your ideas.

o Dot points are allowed in this section.

o Include the grid in the assessment text itself, not as an appendix.

o Although the words in the 6 - point grid do not count toward the word limit for this assignment, you should keep the grid concise.

• Provide a summary of the critical issue (ONLY ONE) based on the PESTEL analysis.

o Write this as a narrative from a 3rd person point of view

o Include in-text citations.

o Length: 200 - 250 words (this total does not include the PESTEL grid).

**Part C: Analysis**

• From your PESTEL analysis, choose 2 or 3 main ethical or sustainability concerns you identified relating to the critical issue.

• Analyse these concerns by applying the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) and at least one ethical framework introduced in this course.

• This part of the report should explain to H&M why they should be worried about the critical issue.

• Draw on course concepts/content in your analysis.

• Write this as a narrative from a 3rd person point of view

• Include in-text citations.

• Length: ±750 words.

**Part D: Recommendations**

• Based on your analysis, recommend 2 or 3 actions H&M can take to address the critical issue.

• Identify potential risks in implementing these recommendations and explain how these risks could be mitigated.

• Write this as a narrative from a 3rd person point of view

• Include in-text citations.

• Length: ±250 words
